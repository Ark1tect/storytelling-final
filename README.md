This is a repository for the final project completed for NYU's Advanced GIS: Interactive Web Mapping Spring of 2024. The project highlights the project currently underway to bring hydroelectric power generated in Quebec to New York City. This project will travel through dozens of towns in the state but will primarily be laid along waterways

Sources primarily included releases from the Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE) project pages, Hydro Quebec, and releases from the Office of the Governor of New York. Further research good assess in more detail the potential environmental impacts of this project outside of energy considerations.
